# Hello-World
First repository
I first learned of on GitHub was in connection with some Electronic Synthsizer circuit boards I was planning to build a few years ago
A fellow named Oliver designed an array of circuits and offered the schematics and necessary firm in a repository, MI
, for Mutable Instruments



Haven't gotten 'round to the build
but now I'm exploring programming

P.S.
I first coded on an Atari 800 circa 1982, BASIC---GOTO 10 Print "fascinating!"
Actually I had attempted to sit in on a FORTRAN lab (punch cards and all) in 1980 at U of KY
I was quickly lost and retreated for a more opportune time

I saw how  a computer could help with doing estimates at our family sign business

Then came the Columbia, an early IBM compatible: dual floppys, 128k, bundled software
for a mere $3000.
