# Hello-World
First repository
I first learned of on GitHub was in connection with some Electronic Synthsizer circuit boards I was planning to build a few years ago
A fellow named Oliver designed an array of circuits and offered the schematics and necessary firm in a repository, MI
, for Mutable Instruments



Haven't gotten 'round to the build
but now I'm exploring programming
